Overview
========
Failed Request Tracing logs are very frequently looked by a few like me, who live on troubleshooting problems. There were a lot of times, I had to choose the right FREB file for a specific scenario, in 100s of files in the folder. This tool helps you in that situation.

Features
========
This Freb Viewer gives you an easy way to select the right file you are looking at, sort by the time-taken to spot the slowest request quickly, search for specific error code, or request text. 'Show the slowness' button is very helpful if you have a very large FREB file, and trying to find where the maximum slowness is.

Benefits
========
Provides an easy to use interface to sort the FREB files.

Requirements
============
.NET 2.0.
